  <textarea rows="4" cols="50" style="font-size:25px" id="input_message" placeholder="This is a input area box"></textarea>

  </p>
  <button type="button" onclick="" class="navButtons">button</button>

  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    [1] Background image at top of each page
  </p>
  <p>
    To get the width padding:20px; </p>
  <p>
    image address url (http://supernatural.buzz/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/binary-code-pattern.png).
  </p>
  <p>
    All located inside the same &lt;div&gt; as the header text.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    [2] Header text at top of each page used within a &lt;h1&gt; tag and contained within same &lt;div&gt; tag as the background image.
  </p>

  <p>
    Font-size 40px; Font-family: courier; text-align: center;
  </p>
  <p>
    To get the the blue and white effect of the text on top of the picture a HTML mark was used.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mark was created in CSS by doing the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the colour behind the text - background-color: <mark>#B0C4DE;</mark>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the colour of the text - color: white;
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the thickness of the mark itself - padding: 10px;
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    [3] Page header,contained within a &lt;div&gt; tag that is used for every cipher Heading.
  </p>
  <p>
    padding: 20px;
  </p>
  <p>
    Style of font - font- family: fantasy;
  </p>
  <p>
    Colour of font - color: grey;
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    [4] Navigation bar used to travel between pages. Contained within one &lt;div&gt; tag as each button has the same class=""
  </p>

  <p>
    4 separate buttons joined together to create one long connected strip.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each button has the background ground colour blue and font color white <mark>Example</mark>
  </p>
  <p>
    Thickness of each button is padding: 20px;
  </p>
  <p>
    Each button has a width:25% as there is 4 buttons that allows the bar to take up the whole width (100%)
  </p>
  <p>
    Font size and font colour respectively 20px; courier;
  </p>

  <p>
    When each button is hovered over the background colour of it changes to #778899, this was accomplished by using the built in css feature: hover.
  </p>

  <br />
  <p>
    [5] The footer is used once and that is on the homepage. Contained within its own &lt;div&gt; tag it also uses the &lt;mark&gt; tag to add colour to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pushes text to center of footer bar text-align: center;
  </p>
  <p>
    Thickiness of bar is width: 100%
  </p>
  <p>
    Pushed down from top 100 pixels, margin-top: 100px;
  </p>

  <p>
    Style of font is font-family: courier;
  </p>
  <br />

  <p>
    [6] Text area used for the input message, there is also an output area but both follow the same CSS. Each text area has its own &lt;div&gt; tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    <p>
      The format on how to create it is below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <xmp>
        <textarea rows="4" cols="30" style="font-size:25px" id="" placeholder=" "></textarea>
      </xmp>
    </p>
    <p>
      The rows and columns define how wide and tall the box is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The font size is used for the input, outout and placeholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The placeholder is a temporary piece of text inside the textarea until the actual input/ouput is used.
    </p>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    [7] Typical example of a button used in both the navigation bar and when encrypting/decrypting a message. The skeleton of it is below:
  </p>
  <p>
    <xmp>
      <button type="button" onclick="" class="">button</button>
    </xmp>
<p>
  onclick() is the path the button takes when its been clicked. For me it was used for my javascript encry and decrypt functions for each cipher.
</p>
class is related to the name of the &lt;div&gt; tag that it gets its design properties from.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, in between the open and close it says button, this is simply the text that will be displayed in the button. 
  </p>
